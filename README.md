# A study on North America Energy Production vs. Currency Strength

## Background

Canada is the sixth largest energy producer and the fourth largest net exporter in the world. Canada’s energy sector accounts for over 10% of its nominal GDP, and it is a large contribution to the Canada government’s revenue as well. Moreover, every year government spent more than 1 billion on the energy research, development, and deployment. Due to the fact that a large amount of the Canada’s total foreign exchange earnings are gained through the crude oil sales, the exchange rate of Canada is strongly correlated to the price of oil. Therefore, this project analyzes the correlation between energy production and the economics of U.S and Canada, in terms of oil exports, GDP and dollar index or exchange rate. Despite the large oil reserve in Canada, the world is shifting towards using clean and renewable energy. Thus, the renewable energy production trend in the past 15 years is analyzed as well to see how this change in energy industry will affect Canadian economy and dollar strength for the future.

## Purpose

This project focuses on examining how oil production and currency are connected. The scope of this project focuses on Canada and U.S only. In this project, multiple datasets from Stats Canada, US EIA, Exchange Rate Open API are extracted, transformed and analyzed to see the total crude production and the GDP contribution of oil export data of each country and the correlation with their currency values. The results from the data can lead to further understandings of how currency values impacted in the near future, when the world is shifting towards cleaner, lower cost, and sustainable energy sources, and thus less relying on crude production.
